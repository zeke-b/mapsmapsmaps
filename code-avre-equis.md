ALBUM TITLE:
Code-avre exquis

DESCRIPTION:
A mapcore artist compilation based around Teletype. These coders, hackers, musicians, alchemists, cartographers, and practitioners of other arcane arts produced tracks by following the following guidelines:

1. Participants were sorted into a random order with places 1-10.

2. The first participant created a scene in Teletype and recorded their track within 7 days. Once finished they didn't share the recorded track with anyone.

3. Upon recording their track, they passed their scene, in its entirety to the next participant in the queue with no notes. The next participant edited the scene as they saw fit and then created a patch and recorded their track.

4. Steps 3 and 4 were repeated until the last participant edited the scene they received and recorded their own track.

KEY CONCEPT:
A blindness to the sound created with code received will yield wildly different results from participant to participant even without substantial editing.

COMMENTARY:
This compilation presents what we hope is a new method of collaboration for 21st century artists utilizing code for the creation of sound and music. This exercise owes equal debt to the exploratory and whimsical spirit of 20th century painters as it does to to the structure and practice of devs from the last several decades.
